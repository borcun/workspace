* AWK
The input is read in units called records, and processed by the rules one record at a time. By default, each record
is one line. Each record is split automatically into fields, to make it more convenient for a rule to work on its
parts. The following abbreviations such as RS, FS are built-in variable, so no need to put $ before them when using.

- *RS (Record Separator):* Line separator that is used to parse whole file,
  default line separator is newline character (\n)
- *ORS (Output Record Separator):* Output record separator that is used to separator output records according to a separator
- *FS (Field Separator):* Field separator that is used to parse a record, it may be a string that includes several separators
- *OFS (Output File Separator):* Output file separator that is used by print function when printing $1, $2, etc. fields
- *NF (Number of Field):* Number of field that indicates count of fields of current record
- *NR (Number of Record):* Number of record that indicates current record number i.e. 1 for first line, 2 for second line
  if there are more input file than one, NR increases when passing next file
- *FNR (File Number of Record):* It is special to input file that is processed at that instant, it starts from 1 for next file
- *OFMT (Ouput Format):* Output format that is used by print to format its inputs (i.e. %d format prints number as integer)
  
*Note 1:* The actual input is untouched: awk never modifies the input file.
